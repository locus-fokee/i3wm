# i3wm
Personalised i3wm configuration file based on my need, wants, flavour taste., theme, etc. You can see the code and use it for your own desktop, if this config also suites your needs and taste. Note: I don't know what OS you maybe using. I am on Arch Linux. So, I guess I should and will work on x86_64 Linux Platforms. Anyways, Thank you.
